         Iâ€™m a Software Developer who can juggle Code and a football!
         From winning college championships to rocking the stage with mime and dramaâ€”and even walking the fashion rampâ€”I mix logic with creativity. 
         Whether itâ€™s debugging after volleyball or shipping code post-rehearsals,
          I thrive under pressure and love bringing energy to both code and crowd. ðŸ’»âš½ðŸŽ­
